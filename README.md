## Professional Summary

I am a software engineer from Okitipupa, Ondo State, Nigeria, with practical experience in front end development, startup product design, and remote operational support.

My journey into technology is driven by ownership. I like understanding how systems work from the interface users touch down to the infrastructure and security decisions that keep those systems dependable.

Beyond writing code, I think deeply about product direction, user trust, performance, and long term growth. I am currently advancing my cybersecurity knowledge to ensure the platforms I help build are resilient and safe.

I am comfortable working independently, learning quickly, and contributing meaningfully to distributed teams.
