## About Me

I am a Nigerian developer from Okitipupa in Ondo State.  
My path into technology started with curiosity about how digital products work and quickly grew into building real systems.

I have hands on experience with front end development, product thinking, and early stage startup execution. Recently I have been deepening my knowledge in cybersecurity and networking so I can design platforms that are not only useful but also secure and reliable.

I learn fast, adapt quickly, and enjoy taking ownership of problems from idea to deployment.

## Flagship Project

### Zudomart

Zudomart is an ambitious digital commerce and creator infrastructure platform built for African users.

The vision is simple.  
Give entrepreneurs, freelancers, creators, and businesses one place to trade, promote, earn, and grow.

Core ideas behind the platform include:

* Marketplace for products and services  
* Short form video discovery  
* Gig and freelance opportunities  
* Live streaming and audience engagement  
* Seller tools including payments and order management  
* Integrated communication between buyers and sellers  

Development is ongoing and the goal is to launch a strong MVP, validate adoption, and scale from there.

**Status:** actively building and refining  
**Collaboration:** open to technical and growth partners  
**Investment:** open to early conversations
