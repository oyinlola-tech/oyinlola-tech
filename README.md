# 👋🏽 Hey there, I'm Oluwayemi Oyinlola Michael!

> 🧠 “Tech is the modern-day magic. I’m just here learning the spells.”

I'm a self-taught **Front-End Developer,** an aspiring **Cybersecurity Specialist,** and the founder of **ZudoMart** — a bold idea to empower **African students and entrepreneurs** with a platform that blends **Fiverr, TikTok, Jumia, and Twitch** into one digital ecosystem.

Currently based in *Okitipupa, Ondo State, Nigeria 🇳🇬*, I spend my time learning, building, dreaming, and hustling to create value with code.

## 🛤 My Journey So Far

I began my tech journey after leaving *Miva University*. Instead of giving up, I decided to bet on myself — learning from online resources, taking certification programs, and building real ideas like ZudoMart from scratch.

💻 From writing my first line of HTML  
🔐 To understanding how networks work in cybersecurity  
🧠 To pitching startup ideas to investors...  
It’s been a wild, rewarding ride — and it’s only just starting.

> 💡 Imagine one platform built by Africans, for Africans — and that’s ZudoMart.
