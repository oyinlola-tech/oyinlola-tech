## Profile

I am a Nigerian software engineer with experience in front end development, product architecture, and startup execution.

My work sits at the intersection of engineering, security awareness, and business reality. I care about how software behaves in production, how users experience it, and how teams can maintain and grow it over time.

Alongside development, I bring structured operational support from my background as a trained virtual assistant. This allows me to contribute beyond code through documentation, coordination, and communication.

I am currently expanding my practical cybersecurity capability while continuing to ship ambitious platforms.
